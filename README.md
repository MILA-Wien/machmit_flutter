# frontend_machmit_kern

A new Flutter project.

## Developing


1. [Install flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) depending to your OS.
2. Our team uses [VisualStudioCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) for developing. Therefore you need to install two extensions named "Dart" and "Flutter" on VSCode.
3. Install [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) if you haven't done before.
4. Set up the [core](https://github.com/MILA-Wien/machmit-kern-backend) backend with docker and start it locally via `docker-compose up -d`.
5. Open this repository in VSCode, open /lib/main.dart and run it with the Play-Button on the top-right corner.
